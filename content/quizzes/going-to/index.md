# Talking about the future with 'going to' 
***

In English, there are a lot of different ways to talk about the future and they all have a slightly different meaning.

The one we're looking at for this lesson is 'going to'.

We use it to talk about **a decision we've made** about **some action in the future**.

**That's important: the decision is already made. We have a plan.**

Example:

* *I'm going to* learn English in 2023.
* *He's going to* come home from America after the summer.
* *She's going to* go to Australia when she gets her visa.

In these examples, the action is in the future but the plan is already made, so:

* I'm going to learn English in 2023. I decided this last week and already bought some books.

## Construction:

* Person + to be + going to + verb
***
* I + am + going to + learn English. ==> I'm going to learn English.
***
* She + is + going to + come home. ==> She's going to come home.


## Questions
To ask a (yes/no) question about a future plan:

* Are you going to + verb....?
* Is he going to + verb .....?
* Is she going to + verb ....?
* Are they going to + verb ..?

Example:

*Are you going to* buy a new shirt for the wedding?

### Questions with 'What ...?'
To ask an open question, use what:

* *What are you going to* wear to the wedding?
* *What is she going to* wear to the wedding?
