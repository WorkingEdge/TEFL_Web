# Questions with 'Have you + verb(3rd) ...?'
Usually, this construction is used when we want to ask about the past but we consider the timeframe of the question as open.

Example:

"Have you seen James today?"

This is fine because 'today' is not over - the timeframe for the question is open.

If we define a timeframe that is closed, we use the past simple:

"Did you see James last week?"


## 1. Have you ever ... ?
"Have you ever ..." is a good question when you have no idea what the answer might be and you are talking about a person's experiences in their life so far.

For example, if you are talking with somebody for the first time, you might ask:

"Have you ever been outside of Europe?"

"Have you ever seen the northern lights?"


## 2. Have you ___________________________ yet?
Usually, this type of question means that the person asking the question has some *expectation* around the action.

For example, imagine this scenario:
Last week, your friend applied for a job at a new company and then they went for an interview at the company.
Now, they are waiting to find out if they got the job.
The expectation is that they will receive some response from the company.

You might ask:

Have you received a reply from the company yet?

## 3. Have you not _____________________ yet?
This one also shows some expectation and often means the person asking the question is surprised that some expected action has not happened.

In the job interview example above, let's say you visit your friend after a month. You expect that they will know about the job:

A: "Hey. How are things?"

B: "OK, I'm still waiting to get a reply from the company."

A: "What!? **Have you not *heard from them* yet**?"
