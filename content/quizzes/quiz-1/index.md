# Using For and Since

Use for an since to talk about the length of time that something has been happening.


### For
Use 'for' when mentioning the amount of time.
For example:

I've been reading this book for **3 weeks**.

I've been playing chess for **20 years**.

*3 weeks* and *20 years* are an amount of time.

#### Since
Use since when mentioning a point in time (past).
The *point in time* can be from a specific clock time, or calendar time, or it can be a past action.
For example:

I've been following this series on Netflix since **January first** (1).

I've been playing chess since I **started secondary school**.

She's been feeling unwell since she **ate that sandwich**.
